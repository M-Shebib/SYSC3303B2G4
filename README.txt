naming convention
-Config : A class that is named to reflect the purpose of the class which is to configure values that will be used in the three subystems.

-Elevator : This thread is named after the subsystem it controls which is the elevator subsystem which is focused on the movement of the elevator and it's position.

-ElevatorData : This is a text file with some sample data that is used to test the project.

-Floor : This is a thread that is named after the fact that it is in charge of the Floor subsystem which reads and interprets the inputs of which floor is the destination as well as what is the time and current floor.

-Scheduler : This thread is named for being in charge of the scheduler subsystem which communicates with the Floor and Elevator Subsystems to give them the necessary information to run properly.
